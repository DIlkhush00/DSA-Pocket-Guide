# Contributing Guidelines

You want to contribute? That's awesome! Just make sure you follow the rules below:

   1. When submitting an algorithm, please include a comment block at the beginning with the following format:
     ```cpp
     /* 
         Algorithm Name: __
         Time Complexity:  __
         Space Complexity: __
     */
     ```
   > Replace the `__` with the appropriate values.

2.  Wherever possible, please add comments to your code and use meaningful variable names. This will help others understand the code more easily.

That's all for now!
